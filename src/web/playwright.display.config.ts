/**
 * The display proof's own runner, for the reason `playwright.rebuild.config.ts`
 * is the rebuild's: it needs one editor preview on one port, and it starts a
 * real host itself.
 *
 * `playwright.config.ts` boots 4173/4174/4175 and the shared host, which every
 * other agent and the root session also uses. Two agents on one preview is how
 * a pass ends up screenshotting somebody else's theme — which the plan records
 * as having already happened twice.
 *
 * The host is **not** a `webServer` here: its themes directory is written by the
 * test, from the package the editor's own Save control produced, so it cannot
 * exist before the test runs.
