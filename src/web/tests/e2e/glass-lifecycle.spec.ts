/**
 * The lifecycle property, measured on the real editor and the real fixture.
 *
 * **Not** "zero repaints in 1000 ms". Task 1 measured that on a bare
 * `StaticCanvas`; the editor runs a 30 Hz chart-refresh loop of its own, so an
 * idle editor repaints about 22 times a second whatever glass is doing.
 * Asserting zero here would assert a fact about a loop this task does not
 * own, and it would fail for a reason unrelated to glass. Measured, not
 * assumed: every one of those 22 requests stacks to `LiveRuntime.refresh`
 * and `ChartManager.refresh`.
 *
 * The property that *is* this task's is the **delta**: a glass panel must not
 * add a repaint of its own. That is measured by comparing the same scene with
 * and without the panel, so the editor's own refresh cancels out, and by
 * counting composites at the panel - one per editor frame means the owner is
 * riding frames someone else asked for rather than making or missing any.
