 * preserves which channel dominates; a hue sweep does not give a reading that
 * separates "the glass resampled" from "the glass held a stale frame", because
 * the dominant channel of a mid-hue frame is whatever the sweep last passed.
 * Red against blue is unambiguous in both directions.
 *
 * **A long dwell, because a short one makes the test unanswerable.** The panel
 * composites whichever frame the media held at its last repaint, so a reading
 * taken across a transition legitimately disagrees with the source read beside
 * it. At a 250 ms dwell that accounted for 5 of 12 readings (measured), which
 * says nothing about the glass. A second and a half per state leaves a wide
 * window in which source and panel must agree, and the reader discards a

/**
 * The video frame callback, and what the player can and cannot see of it.
 *
 * `followFrames` arms `requestVideoFrameCallback` so a playing video repaints
 * the glass beneath it. On the **editor** it is the only thing that does: the
 * editor's media mount hands `requestRenderAll` to `onFrame` and the editor
 * runs no repaint loop of its own, so without the callback a frosted panel
 * freezes on the video's first frame. (`background-media.dom.test.ts` covers
 * the arming and the re-arming; nothing browser-tests the editor's freeze,
 * which is a named gap, not a claim here.)
 *
 * The **player** is different, and this is the measurement rather than the
 * expectation. Both of its mount paths start `startChartRefresh(tick, 30)` on
 * `requestAnimationFrame`, so it already repaints on every animation frame the
 * compositor offers — and a video frame is presented *as* an animation frame,
 * so the callback's `requestRenderAll` lands in a frame that already has one
 * and Fabric coalesces the two into a single render. Counted over three
 * seconds on this machine, against the per-frame clip above:
 *
 * ```
 *                      requestRenderAll calls   renders   rVFC deliveries
 *   callback deleted           92                 40            0
 *   callback armed            143                 50           49
 * ```
 *
 * 92 requests already became 40 renders with no callback at all, and the
 * callback's 51 extra requests added 10 renders. **The player cannot attribute
 * renders to this mechanism**, and a test that passed with the mechanism
 * removed would be a test of something else.
 *
 * So the test asserts the two things that are true and machine-independent:
 *
 * 1. **The mechanism is live and following frames.** If `followFrames` rots,
 *    delivery stops and this goes red.
 * 2. **Withholding delivery does not collapse the display's repainting** — the
 *    control, run mid-mount on the same page and the same scene. This is the
 *    non-distinguishability stated as a measurement, and it is also the
 *    tripwire: if the player ever stops repainting on animation frames, the
 *    second phase collapses and this goes red at the moment the callback
 *    *does* become load-bearing.
 *
 * Delivery is switched by **withholding the callback from the page**, not by
 * removing the API, so the product's own arming path runs in both phases and
 * they differ by exactly one variable.
