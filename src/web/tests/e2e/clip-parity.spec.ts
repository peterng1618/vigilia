/**
 * The artboard clip beside the two clips that were already there.
 *
 * `vg-046` says Fabric has no scene-level clip that is free: `clipPath` is
 * per-object, so the obvious repairs land on top of the crop manager's authored
 * per-image clip and the derived text-box clip. The editor takes a route that is
 * neither — `canvas.clipPath`, scene-level and on no object (`editor-shell.ts`,
 * `artboardClip`) — and that route was argued from Fabric's source. **Nobody
 * measured it.**
 *
 * So this measures it. One scene, two clips, **one document** through both
 * surfaces: the editor opens the exported package through its own `Open package`
 * control, and a real host serves the same document to the player. The claim is
 * not "both clip at the artboard" — `host-bleed.spec.ts` already carries that.
 * It is the narrower one the row asks for: the artboard clip does not
 * *interfere* with a clip that already existed, and the two surfaces agree on
 * the pixels.
 *
 * ## Why the read is a classifier and not `canvas.getObjects()`
 *
 * The artboard clip is a `StaticCanvas` property and Fabric never puts it on an
 * object — which is the whole reason the route is free, and also why reading the
 * scene graph cannot see a collision with it. Both per-object clips are ordinary
 * `FabricObject.clipPath`s, so a collision would be a question about rendered
 * output rather than about properties. Everything below is a pixel class read off
 * a backing store.
 *
 * ## What each case had to be, for the clips to be visible at all
 *
 * **The crop.** A four-quadrant SVG under an authored crop that keeps exactly
 * its right half, hanging 80 units off the right edge. Red and blue are the half
 * the author threw away and green and yellow the half they kept, so a clip that
 * was truncated, shifted, mirrored or replaced announces itself as a colour
 * rather than as a number. The kept half **straddles** the artboard edge, which
 * is the only arrangement in which the two clips overlap at all: crop the left
 * half instead and the artboard clip would never touch it, so there would be
 * nothing to measure.
 *
 * **The text box.** `vigiliaText.box` **shorter than one line** — 20 units at
 * `fontSize 40`. `withLineCapacity` derives a `maxLines` from that box, but
 * nothing writes it onto the object: only `fits()` reads it, and `fits()` is
 * reached on the ellipsis path alone. So with `overflow: "clip"` the text lays
 * out every line it has and **`applyClip` is the only thing that cuts them**,
 * which is what makes this the decisive case rather than the obvious "a long
 * paragraph in a box", where the clip has nothing to bite on. A twin box
 * carries the same glyphs at the same size with `overflow: "visible"` and so
 * **no clip at all**, which is what the clip's own behaviour is measured
 * against, rather than a font metric guessed here. Both boxes hang off the same
 * edge.
