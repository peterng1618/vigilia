/**
 * The authored glass scene the browser proof renders.
 *
 * **Only the editor mount uses this.** The player would load the same envelope
 * through the host, but its background media 404s there - the resolver and the
 * host's asset route disagree about the `assets/` prefix, recorded in
 * [issue #3](https://github.com/peterng1618/vigilia/issues/3) - so the player's media
 * path has no end-to-end proof yet. There is no player spec for this fixture and
 * this header used to claim otherwise.
 *
 * **The media is the only backdrop, and nothing opaque is drawn over it.** A
 * first version put 160 opaque bars in the scene as texture; they hid the media
 * layer completely, so the panel sampled bars and the media-offset claim had
 * nothing to measure. The media image now carries the high-frequency texture
 * itself, so one source answers both questions: is the backdrop softened, and
 * does the panel show the part of the media behind it.
 *
 * The artboard is 4:3, so the media layer does carry a real offset - but in the
 * editor's stage it is **vertical only**, and a vertical stripe cannot detect a
 * horizontal misplacement. What this fixture pins for placement is therefore the
 * layer's scale and vertical position; the horizontal `deviceLeft` term is
 * pinned arithmetically only, because both mounts happen to put the layer at
 * `left = 0`. That gap rides with the bug's pickup action.
 *
 * No foreground **text**: this container has no usable font and renders
 * "FROST" as a placeholder dash, so the sharp-foreground claim is not
 * measurable here. That half is Task 11's, where font work is already in
 * scope.
