 * lower canvas, taken inside the page: it says what the renderer put there.
 *
 * **The starter scene cannot make this case on its own.** Measured in Chromium
 * at the default fit: the board is 1672 scene units wide and the canvas is 626
 * device-independent pixels, so the board fills the canvas exactly and the
 * widest card stops at 1632 — inside the board, with nothing overhanging to
 * clip and no pasteboard to read. Zooming out is what makes the case real: at
 * half fit the board's right edge lands at x≈469 on a 626px stage with the
 * pasteboard beside it, so "past the edge" is a point the canvas can show
 * rather than a point off the end of the backing store. Both facts were read
 * off this scene rather than assumed; an earlier version of this file sampled
 * off-canvas and would have passed with the clip deleted.
