 * The browser measure, shared by both mounts.
 *
 * `node-canvas` accepts `ctx.filter` and ignores it, so nothing here can be
 * checked in the unit suite: the blur and the media's decoded pixels both need
 * a real rasteriser.
 *
 * The statistic is a **located measure, never a mean**. A mean over a panel
 * stays identical whether a backdrop was blurred correctly, half-shifted or
 * tinted; a peak adjacent-column gradient does not.
 *
 * The band is placed from the panel's own device box, never from hand-picked
 * artboard coordinates. Three mistakes shaped that, each recorded because it
 * produced a confident wrong number first:
 *
 *  - `getElement()` on an interactive Fabric `Canvas` returns the **upper**
 *    canvas, the interaction layer. The scene is on `lowerCanvasEl`.
 *  - A band that reaches the panel's own 2px stroke reads a composite of about
 *    240 as content, and two statistics then passed **vacuously** on an empty
 *    band. The band is placed inside the straight part and its row count is
 *    asserted.
 *  - The first column that reaches the minimum is a flat run's **left edge**,
 *    not its centre — a 30px error on a marker this wide. Positions are run
 *    midpoints.
