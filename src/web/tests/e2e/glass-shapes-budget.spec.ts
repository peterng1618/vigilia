/**
 * Task F's re-measure: what a frosted **Circle, Ellipse, Triangle and Polygon**
 * costs per frame at radius 48, against a frosted **Rect** of the same box.
 *
 * Why this is a re-measure and not an extension of Task 1's number: that sweep
 * was rectangles only, and two things about the cost are shape-dependent. A
 * triangle's area-to-perimeter ratio differs from a rect's, and `sampleRegion`
 * pads the sampled box by twice the blur radius on each side — so the blur is
 * not proportional to the shape's area, and a shape with the same bounding box
 * is not the same bill.
 *
 * **The comparison is like-for-like by bounding box, not by area.** Every shape
 * below is given the *same* 240x160 box, so the sampled region is identical
 * across all five and what moves is the composite over it. That isolates the
 * thing the widening changed. A triangle covering half its box then does less
 * work than a rect, which is the honest direction of the difference and is
 * stated rather than engineered away.
 *
 * The scene is a photograph, not the stripe fixture: the pass's rule is that
 * glass is measured over a photograph, and a stripe pattern flatters a blur in
 * a way a photograph does not.

 * than the entire signal. Sequencing cannot fix that: whatever the machine did
 * between the first shape and the last is charged to whichever was measuring.
 *
 * **Attempt two** interleaved the shapes across trials, which fixed the
 * ordering bias and still could not resolve anything: the floor range was
 * 5.4-11.5 ms and individual trials swung -3.3 to +4.9 ms. The cause is the
 * *block* structure — thirty renders with, then thirty without, so about a
 * second and a half of machine drift lands wholly on one arm of the pair.
 *
 * So the two arms are interleaved **inside** the pair, frame by frame, and the
 * statistic is the median of the *paired differences* rather than the difference
 * of two medians. A drift that is slow compared with one frame now moves both
 * members of a pair together and cancels, and a single GC pause moves one pair
 * rather than a whole run — which is what the median is there to absorb.
 *
 * One shape per scene, too. With five frosted panels the "without" arm is a
 * scene with four glass panels still compositing, so the delta is marginal
 * rather than total and the arms differ by more than the treatment.
