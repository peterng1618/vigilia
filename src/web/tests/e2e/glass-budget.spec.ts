/**
 * The artboard Task 1 set its budget on: **1672x941, the same one**, at the
 * same DPR and in the same browser family.
 *
 * What that does and does not make comparable, stated plainly because an
 * earlier version of this header got it wrong in the direction that mattered:
 *
 *  - **Comparable in kind, not in figure.** Task 1's 0.61 ms is a *delta* for
 *    **three** panels at hardcoded zoom 0.6 on a bare `StaticCanvas`, radius 0
 *    against 12. This is a delta for **every** panel the scene carries, in the
 *    real editor at `zoomToFit` (0.765, 1.63x the area), all of them removed
 *    against all of them kept.
 *    Neither is a per-panel figure, so a ratio between them measures nothing
 *    and none is quoted here.
 *  - **The scene differs**: panel count, zoom, and whether a background media
 *    layer is present at all. The artboard, DPR and browser family match.
 *
 * What survives on this data: a glass composite costs roughly 1-2 ms marginal
 * per frame in the real editor, is flat in radius, and - from the paired
 * no-media curve below - is **not** dominated by the media repaint. Whether
 * that is above a budget that was set for a different configuration is
 * unresolvable here in both directions, and the `< 3 ms` assertion below is
 * this task's own regression bound, not a budget conformance claim.
