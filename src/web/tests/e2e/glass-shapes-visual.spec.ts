/**
 * The browser proof that a frosted **Circle** and a frosted **Triangle** are
 * genuinely frosted, over a real photograph.
 *
 * **Measured by screenshot, never by `getImageData` on the live canvas.** This
 * pass has already produced a confident false finding six times over from
 * exactly that: a readback racing Fabric's repaint reads a frame nobody was
 * shown. Every number here is decoded from a PNG the compositor produced, in
 * Node, after two animation frames.
 *
 * ## The statistic, and why not "the interior is brighter"
 *
 * A tint also raises the interior luma, so brightness alone cannot tell a
 * frosted card from a painted one. Three probes together can:
 *
 *  1. **The authoring decision.** Tinted is the card surface at 85% with no
 *     treatment; frosted is the frosted surface at 30% with it. That is what
 *     the author does, and it is the comparison the pass's 0.216 → 0.718
 *     measured. An earlier version of this file compared the frosted surface
 *     against *itself* with the treatment off, which isolates the blur alone —
 *     the smaller half of the decision — and cannot reproduce that reading.
 *  2. **Transmission** — interior luma over the backdrop immediately beside the
 *     card. The reference is the card's own bounding-box corner, which is
 *     outside a circle and a triangle alike, so it is the same few pixels of
 *     photograph and not a probe somewhere else in the frame.
 *  3. **The clear-fill control.** The same shape painting nothing, with the
 *     treatment on, which shows the composite itself rather than a surface laid
 *     over it.
 *
 * **Diffusion is not asserted here.** The starter photograph is smooth at the
 * scale of a 120 px card — a scan of its bands put the sharpest adjacent-pixel
 * step at 2-7 luma across every candidate position — so a blur has almost
 * nothing to flatten and the probe cannot separate a blurred card from a sharp
 * one. `glass.spec.ts` asserts diffusion on the high-frequency stripe fixture,
 * which exists for exactly that reason; this file is about the photograph and
 * about the shape, and it says so rather than asserting a number it cannot
 * support.
 * ## Why the card sits where it does
 *
 * The starter photograph runs from a bright band to a near-black one over about
 * 400 device px, and the first two attempts at this fixture put the cards
 * across that boundary. A card straddling it measures the *photograph*, not
 * the glass: the interior read 26 luma against a corner reading 162, and
 * "transmission" computed from that is a statement about the picture. The
 * cards below sit inside one band, chosen by measuring it — around 126 luma
 * with 24-31 luma of local step, so there is both a level to transmit and
 * detail for the blur to flatten.

 * **This was `http://127.0.0.1:4219/`, a port nothing in this repo serves** —
