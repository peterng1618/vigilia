/**
 * The whole publish loop, proved on a real host: an author edits a document in
 * the editor, a display showing the same theme follows the edit, and the author
 * leaving puts the display back on the stored theme.
 *
 * **The editor is driven through the host's own `/editor/` mount**, never a
 * `vite preview` server. `createThemeLibraryClient()` fetches same-origin
 * (`baseUrl: ""`), and under `vite preview` the preview server answers `/api/*`
 * with a 404 — so the host's `/editor/` mount is the only arrangement in which
 * `/api/hosting`, `/api/publish` and `/api/published` are the same origin as
 * the page. It is loopback-only, which is where Playwright already is.
 *
 * **One real host, on its own port, over its own app folder**, started
 * loopback-only and without `--host` — §145's default and the shape Phase 3
 * built. The LAN is turned on from the editor's own control, which is what
 * starts publishing.
 *
 * **A real phone is not available.** The display here is a phone-sized
 * Chromium (390 × 844), and the QR the header renders is proved by
 * `qr-code.test.ts`'s round-trip through a second library — that the matrix is
 * a QR symbol for the URL, not that a camera reads it off a screen. Nothing in
 * this file closes that gap, and no green run should be read as though it did.
 *
 * **Every helper is a pointer or a keystroke against a delivered control.**
 * The artboard is changed by typing into the panel's own width and height
 * boxes, the way an author does; `rebuild-driver.ts:10-14` states the rule, and
 * a `page.evaluate` writing the scene would be a finding about the surface
 * rather than a technique for this test.
 *
 * **The picture this writes is the proof, and it is only a proof because the
 * artboard is painted.** The published frame is 320x240 against a stored
 * 640x360, so a 4:3 light band on the dark page is the one thing in the file
 * that shows the display followed the editor. `vg-176` made that band absent:
 * the hosted display's `envelopePlan` (`player/src/main.ts:396-408`) passes the
 * artboard paint through unresolved, so a palette reference paints nothing and
 * the page reads black. A capture taken before that row was fixed is a black
 * rectangle proving nothing either way — which is what this task first
 * delivered, and why the capture is registered rather than written to
 * `test-results/`, which is gitignored and persists nothing.
