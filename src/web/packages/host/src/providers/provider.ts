 * and quotes what it ran). A path is as machine-identifying as a port, and both
 * are the host's business rather than the reader's.
 *
 * Deliberately not a bare `host:port` — the dashboard's own vocabulary is
 * `2340:1080` and `19.5:9`, and a redactor that ate those would change what a
 * theme says. The player's net already draws the URL half of this line
 * (`availability-notice.ts`), including its care that a URL match may not end
 * on a colon: a reason reads `... at http://host:8085: fetch failed` and that
 * colon is the sentence's. This is the same line, one layer earlier, covering
 * the paths it never saw.
