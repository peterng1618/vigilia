 * Which physical drive a volume lives on, and what the machine calls it.
 *
 * The library reports a volume's mount and capacity in one list, and a drive's
 * model in another, with no field in common: `fsSize()` knows `C:`, `diskLayout()`
 * knows `\\.\PHYSICALDRIVE1` and the model. Only `blockDevices()` carries both,
 * so resolving a drive model back to a volume is a three-way join. That is why
 * the volume is identified by its model — it is the one name both providers
 * agree on, so a consumer's choice reaches the same drive whichever provider
 * they chose it with.
 *
 * `serialNum` is deliberately absent from these shapes: a serial identifies an
 * instance on this PC, and a theme must not carry one.
