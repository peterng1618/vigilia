 * and was not one. Deriving the time in the browser would be simpler, but the
 * time a dashboard shows should be this PC's: two displays then agree, and a
 * phone with a wrong clock still shows the right time (§116 puts acquisition on
 * the PC).
 *
 * What this sends is an instant, not a finished string. How a clock *reads* is
 * design, so the author's binding formats it; duplicating that here would take
 * the choice away and put a format where a reading belongs.
