/**
 * The control over a selected image's crop.

 * It lives in the selection inspector rather than beside the Assets pane
 * because it acts on the *selection*, not on the asset library: an author crops
 * the image they have already placed, and #23 asks that assets stop having a
 * panel of their own. The inspector is where a control over a selected object
 * already lives.
 *
 * The session is `crop-manager`'s. This starts one, locks a ratio, and applies
 * or abandons it; it owns none of the drag, because the drag is Fabric's own
 * handles on the frame the session installs.
 *
 * The row is a value: `cropView` projects the session's state and `index.ts`
 * owns the four commands, so React holds no session and no Fabric object.
