/**
 * The card library: the starter's eight cards as **units** an author can insert.
 *
 * A unit is the fast path, not the only path — the Add pane offers primitives
 * beside it and calls neither the fallback (§77, §139). What the library adds is
 * that one click brings the whole composition with its readings, its group and
 * its provenance: **a copy, not a twin**.
 *
 * The document is Fabric JSON (§134), so a card is one Fabric `Group` over its
 * parts and its readings live in the envelope's `bindings`, keyed by object id.
 * `instantiateWidget` is that same algorithm over `ThemeNode`, and bridging the
 * two models would mean standing up a second scene tree — so this module is the
 * Fabric-shaped half, and borrows the one piece that is about identity rather
 * than about either model: `createWidgetIdAllocator`, the rule that decides
 * what a fresh id looks like.
 *
 * **Scope limit — the copy is faithful in ids, not necessarily in readings.**
 * `cardBindings` reads the *starter's* bindings map, keyed by the starter's own
 * part ids, so only the parts that map declares can carry a reading — eleven
 * across the eight cards, four of them the CPU card's, against its seven parts.
 * Inserted into a document whose part ids differ, or one an author has renamed,
 * every binding comes across as `null` and **no issue is raised** —
 * `unmapped-global` fires only on `palette.*` / `typePresets.*` string
 * references, never on bindings. "A duplicated card is still a working card"
 * therefore holds for a starter-derived document, and the guarantee narrows to
 * ids everywhere else. The readings are the document's to carry, not this
 * module's to look up by a key it does not have; closing this needs a binding
 * reference that survives being copied, which is a format question, not a
 * lookup.
