 * The theme a boot URL asks for, or the one the author left off, or nothing to

 * reached by URL instead. A saved theme with no way back to it is a
 * write-only surface: the editor could put one in the library and nothing
 * could ever read it again.
 *
 * An id this host does not have is not an error. A bookmark outlives the theme
 * it points at, and a dead one must open the editor's own default rather than
 * a page that says nothing useful.
 *
 * With no id in the URL the author's own most recent save is what opens,
 * because closing the tab and coming back to the theme they were working on is
 * the ordinary round trip and the template is not it. `New theme` and `New from
 * starter` are what a blank document means, and they stay where they were.
