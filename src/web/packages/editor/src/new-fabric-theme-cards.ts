 * Every position and size here is a measurement off
 * `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-26-reference-theme-target.png` at 1672 × 941:
 * the card borders were located by the transition of the two-pixel outline, the
 * text and icons by connected components of bright ink inside each card, and the
 * rings by their saturated strokes. Two departures are named in the report — the
 * trends card spans the full left column rather than the reference's 254-unit
 * gap for the coffee mug, and both ring labels share one offset rather than the
 * mockup's 15-unit disagreement between the two cards.
 *
 * What is not here is anything no provider supplies. The reference names its
 * CPU and GPU models and its storage volume; those three captions are bindings
 * like any other reading, so a machine that cannot say one shows a gap instead
 * of a stand-in name, and a card's name always describes the figures beside it.
