 * A card that declares one id twice *and* carries a part already named `…-2`.
 *
 * The `-2` suffix the guard mints a repeated declaration under is a real id an
 * author may already have written, and `createWidgetIdAllocator` memoises **by
 * key** — so asking for `…-2` twice answers with the id already issued for the
 * genuine part. `nth` is 1 for that genuine part, so no second `id-collision`
 * is reported and `declared` says one, and the duplicate is silent: two objects
 * at one id, `sceneObject` answers `duplicate-id`, `snapshot()` throws and every
 * later save in that session fails — the same outcome the guard above exists to
 * close, arriving by the numbering it introduced.
 *
 * No shipped card part carries a `-2` suffix, so nothing here is a regression
 * anyone can reach today. It is a hole in a guard added one commit ago, and the
 * pin is what says the hole is closed rather than merely unreached.
