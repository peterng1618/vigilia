 *
 * Its own module because `new-fabric-theme.ts` outgrew `AGENTS.md`'s 800-line
 * stop, and the globals are a separable responsibility: they are the document's
 * vocabulary, and every object in the scene is written against them rather than
 * against the scene body.

/**
 * The palette is the single place a colour is named. `solidOf` below repeats
 * the solid ones because a scene object also carries Fabric's own resolved
 * colour beside its `vigiliaPaint` reference — one authored fact, two
 * representations, not two authored facts.
 *
 * The artboard's own paint is `none`, because the backdrop is a packaged media
 * layer mounted below the canvas and an opaque artboard paint would hide it; the
 * letterbox bars outside it are `bars`. `background` survives that change as
 * the **surface token new objects take** — see the note on its entry.

/**
 * The tint a *frosted* panel carries, which is not the tint an opaque one does.
 *
 * Measured from both ends, because it is a floor set by what is behind the glass
 * rather than a look:
 *
 * - **Down.** The frosted card's own `panel` fill is 85% opaque, and a backdrop
 *   behind it reaches the eye at 2.4/255 of contrast — 16.02 blurred backdrop
 *   times (1 − 0.851) = 2.39, which is what the browser reported. A blur applied
 *   under an almost-opaque panel is a blur of nothing.
 * - **Up.** This card sits on the photograph's bright horizon, and the panel's
 *   field is that photograph at (1 − alpha) plus the tint. At 18% the field
 *   measures 0.1874 WCAG luminance and `#ecf5ff` reads **4.02:1** against it —
 *   under AA's 4.5. At 24% it reads 4.49, which passes and is not a floor worth
 *   having on a threshold that moves with the photograph; at 30% the field is
 *   0.135 and the caption reads **5.1:1**.
 *
 * 30% is therefore the floor the contrast requirement sets, not a preference,
 * and the photograph still reads through it: the panel's carried backdrop
 * structure falls from 1.27 to about 1.08 against a 0.6 floor.
