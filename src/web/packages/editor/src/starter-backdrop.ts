 * The starter's artboard backdrop: a photograph, declared like any other

 *
 * It is a photograph because the gradient it replaced had no horizontal
 * structure at all — measured 0.00 mean luma step between adjacent columns,
 * against 2.14 here — so every frosted panel over it read as an even fill no
 * matter how wide the blur was. `docs/decisions/0011` has the measurements and
 * the rejected alternatives, including the runtime-CDN one that would have
 * tainted the canvas and broken every capture that reads pixels.
 *
 * The bytes reach the document through the same `path -> Uint8Array` map every
 * declared asset already travels in, and the player then resolves them through
 * the host's own asset route, so the surface stays same-origin and untainted.
