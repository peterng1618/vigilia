/**
 * The artboard clips the object layer, and the handles do not.
 *
 * `vg-046`: Fabric has no scene-level clip that is free — `clipPath` on an
 * *object* collides with the crop manager's authored image clip and with the
 * derived text-box clip, and wrapping the scene in a Group changes what
 * `canvas.getObjects()` means, which is the layer tree's and every walk's. So
 * this file is mostly the gates that keep both of those routes out, and the
 * one route that satisfies the row is `canvas.clipPath`, which is neither: it
 * is a canvas property, so no object owns it, no object serialises it, and the
 * scene root is still the scene root.
 *
 * Measured on Fabric 7.4.0 (the version this repo pins), which is what decided
 * the shape of this change and corrects one premise in the task brief: Fabric
 * 7 draws selection controls onto the *lower* canvas, not `upperCanvasEl`.
 * `upperCanvasEl` exists but carries only text selection and free drawing. So a
 * DOM clip of the lower canvas — the brief's route — would take the handles
 * with it, which is the one outcome the brief says must not happen. The
 * canvas-level `clipPath` plus `controlsAboveOverlay` is what separates them.

// jsdom cannot decode an `<img>`, so Fabric's render pass throws on one; that
// is the *only* thing stubbed here, and it is stubbed per-source rather than
// for `drawImage` as a whole. The harness this file replaces forwarded every
// draw to one shared context, which is why the object layer read back empty:
// Fabric caches each object onto its own canvas and blits that cache, so
// no-oping `drawImage` no-ops the object layer itself. Keeping jsdom's own
// (node-canvas-backed) context is what lets the clip be measured in pixels
// rather than asserted on Fabric.
