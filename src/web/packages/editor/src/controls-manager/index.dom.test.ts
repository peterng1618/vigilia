 * vg-089: an author applied a type preset taller than the box they wrote, and
 * the text was clipped with no way to move the box by hand — the two vertical
 * handles were hidden. What the handle writes is the part that decides whether
 * it works: Fabric's `height` is re-derived from the wrapped text on every
 * `initDimensions` (`fabric/dist/index.mjs:18452`), so a handle that stopped
 * there would be undone by the next text pass. The authored box is what
 * persists, and the object reads it back.
