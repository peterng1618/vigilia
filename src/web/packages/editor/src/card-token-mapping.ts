/**
 * What a card asks for, and what the document it is inserted into actually has.
 *
 * A card is authored against the starter's vocabulary — `palette.frost`,
 * `typePresets.90-600` — and a document is free to name its tokens anything
 * (`vg-128`). The answer used to be a refusal, because an unresolved reference
 * reaches `snapshot`, which validates and throws: an author gets a canvas that
 * looks right and a save that fails for the rest of the session, told nothing.
 * Refusing was the safe half of that decision and the unusable half too — **on
 * the host's default two-token palette every card refuses, and on a blank theme
 * seven of the eight do**, so the library was dead exactly where an author meets
 * it first.
 *
 * So a reference resolves in this order, and the author is told which step
 * answered:
 *
 * 1. **Exact token id.** The card wants `palette.cpu` and the document has
 *    `palette.cpu`. Nothing is substituted and nothing is reported.
 * 2. **By role.** A palette is a *typed* vocabulary, not a bag of names: a
 *    document that names a surface and a content ink has both, whatever it
 *    calls them. `surface` and `content` are the two roles a card asks for, and
 *    they are the roles `new-object-defaults.ts` already asks the same question
 *    with — this module does not invent a taxonomy beside them.
 * 3. **A literal**, where the document format has a place for one and nothing
 *    else will resolve. See `resolveCardToken`'s return.
 *
 * **A same-named token is never assumed to mean the same thing** (§77). Step 1
 * is the only step that trusts a name, and only when the document declares that
 * name.
 */

/**
 * One reference, resolved.
 *
 * `ref` is a reference this document can paint. `literal` is `true` when the
 * format has somewhere to put the card's own value and no token can answer —
 * a text run's `typePreset`, where the object already carries the size, weight
 * and face as plain Fabric fields and dropping the reference leaves exactly
 * the typography the card was authored with. Neither being set means this
 * document cannot express the reference at all, and the card is refused.
