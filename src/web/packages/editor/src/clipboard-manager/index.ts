 * copies what it was given as `taken`: a fresh allocator per object would copy
 * it once per node, so a deep paste is quadratic in the tree. Sharing per type
 * also preserves the memoisation that makes two members of the same kind share
 * one sanitisation, which is what the bump below then has to correct for.
 *

 * a binding is keyed by the object that shows it, so without this a card comes
 * back named after a CPU card, shows nothing, and prints no key in the tree.

 *
 * **A copy is a copy, not a twin.** Two things have to move together or the
 * author is handed a lie:
 *
 *  - The envelope's `bindings` are keyed by object id, and a pasted object has a
 *    new one, so its readings are stripped at the next save by the same
 *    `dropDanglingBindings` that protects a deleted object. The copy arrives
 *    showing nothing at all.
 *  - A run names its binding by id, so copying a binding *under the original's
 *    id* would leave two entries claiming one binding id — the validator's
 *    `duplicate-id`, and an unsaveable session for the rest of the editing
 *    session. Fresh binding ids with the runs repointed are the only shape that
 *    both keeps the readings and keeps the document valid.
 *
 * The semantic keys are carried across unchanged: a copy bound to a sensor
 * nobody else names is not a copy of anything.
 *
 * Binding ids are minted by the same allocator as object ids, so a pasted card
 * reads `binding-cpu-card-load-2` rather than a uuid — one policy for what a
 * fresh id looks like, whichever kind it is.
 *
 * The allocator's issues are reported, not swallowed: an id it could not derive
 * is one the copy carries unchanged, which is the `duplicate-id` this walk
 * exists to prevent, and a paste that cannot be saved should not look saved.
