/**
 * A card the theme cannot express, through each surface that offers one.
 *
 * **Reachable, not theoretical.** On a blank theme (`File > New`) the palette
 * carries ten tokens and the cards name `palette.cpu`, `palette.gpu`,
 * `palette.ram`, `palette.vram`, `palette.down`, `palette.sparkArea` and
 * `palette.storageFill` — so only Clock survives. The author inserts a `CPU`
 * card, and before this was fixed **nothing happened, nothing was said**, and an
 * unhandled rejection went to the console.
 *
 * The cause was a per-surface one, which is why this drives every surface rather
 * than one: the Add pane wrapped the promise in `constructing`, which reported
 * it, and the canvas context menu dispatched through a façade typed
 * `insertCard(cardId): void`, which **discarded** the rejecting promise. One of
 * two surfaces swallowed the refusal. That surface list was three until the
 * header's Insert menu was deleted (§7.1: Insert lives in the Add pane), which
 * removed one swallowed refusal rather than one case.
 *
 * Every surface here is the real one — the real panel, the real context menu —
 * against a real `EditorSession` on a blank theme, so this fails if any surface
 * stops reaching the owner or the owner stops reporting.
