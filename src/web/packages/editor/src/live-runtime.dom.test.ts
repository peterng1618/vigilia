/**
 * What the refresh loop costs, counted.
 *
 * The loop runs at the author's chart rate — 30 fps by default — and it used to
 * run both text passes on every tick over every object in the document. A
 * percentage of blocked main thread is the wrong thing to assert: it moves with
 * the machine, the build, and whatever else is running. How many times a text
 * object was re-measured in a fixed interval is not, so that is what these
 * assert. `initDimensions` is Fabric's full re-measure — it re-splits the text,
 * rebuilds the per-line style map and re-measures every grapheme
 * (`fabric/dist/index.mjs:18447`).
