 * The answer is `HostingStore`'s — the same one the header's publish control
 * reads — and the mark is drawn **only** when the host reports the LAN on. An
 * unknown or absent host renders nothing rather than "not live": until the host
 * has answered the editor has nothing to say, and a mark invented for it would
 * be a fact the product does not have (bible §9). Nothing here polls the host;
 * a state changed outside the editor is stale until reload (`vg-214`).
