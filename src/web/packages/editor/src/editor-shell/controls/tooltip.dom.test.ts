/**
 * The editor's one tooltip, as a DOM function.
 *
 * The point of these cases is that the two callers cannot both be right unless
 * the behaviour is shared: `canvas-dock.tsx` is React, the selection inspector
 * builds elements with `document.createElement` and never sees React, and a
 * popup only one of them can use would be a second owner for it. So the contract
 * is the behaviour, and every case here is a behaviour a mouse-only
 * implementation would fail.
