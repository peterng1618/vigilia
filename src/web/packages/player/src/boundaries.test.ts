/**
 * The player's import boundary, asserted rather than hoped for.
 *
 * ## Why this exists at all
 *
 * §47 requires the display-only bundle to download no editor controls or
 * inspectors, and until now the **only** thing enforcing that was
 * `scripts/check-size.mjs` noticing the bundle got bigger. Measured
 * 2026-09-15: the player is 201.1 KB gzip against a 400 KB budget, so there is
 * ~199 KB of slack — enough to leak the entire editor and still pass. A gate
 * with 2x headroom detects nothing, which makes it the wrong instrument for a
 * boundary. This catches the leak at the import, where it can be explained.
 *
 * ## Why Fabric made it urgent
 *
 * Two of the three rules below are Fabric-specific and both cost real bytes:
 *
 * - **`fabric` versus `fabric/es`.** The default entry resolves to one
 *   pre-bundled, pre-minified file that a tree-shaker cannot see into. The same
 *   five named imports measured **95.0 KB gzip through `fabric` and 49.3 KB
 *   through `fabric/es`**. `./es` carries the same type declarations, so there
 *   is no reason to take the expensive one — but it is the shorter, more
 *   habitual specifier, and nothing else would ever flag it.
 * - **`StaticCanvas` versus `Canvas`.** The interactive canvas brings pointer
 *   handling, selection and drag: **+31.0 KB gzip** the player can never use.
 *   `StaticCanvas` genuinely excludes them, so the shared scene adapter must
 *   stay canvas-agnostic and take a `StaticCanvas`, leaving `packages/editor`
 *   as the only place that constructs the interactive one. If that inverts, the
 *   player inherits the editor's canvas through a shared module and the size
 *   gate absorbs it in silence.
 *
 * Spec 0013 records the measurements.
