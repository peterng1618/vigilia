/**
 * The artboard is a clip, and revival used to take it away.
 *
 * `mountFabricScene` installs a `clipPath` sized to the artboard and paints
 * the artboard's own background. `reviveThemeEnvelope` then calls Fabric's
 * `canvas.loadFromJSON`, which sets `backgroundColor` and `clipPath` from the
 * revived document — and a Vigilia scene document carries neither, because
 * both are artboard state rather than scene state. Fabric assigns `undefined`
 * to each, so the clip and the paint are both gone by the time the display
 * has its objects.
 *
 * Measured on a real hosted display at 412×839: with a 1920×1080 artboard
 * letterboxed into 839px, an object authored 60 units above the artboard's top
 * edge painted at y=291 — 12 pixels *above* the artboard, out over the
 * letterbox bar, where it is fully visible on a wall and on a phone. The crop
 * notice is built on the opposite premise ("Fabric clips the canvas to the
 * artboard rect, so an object outside it is drawn nowhere"), so on the hosted
 * path it was reporting objects as "not shown" while the renderer was showing
 * them.
