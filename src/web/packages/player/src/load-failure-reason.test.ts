 * again. It was bypassed once: `main.ts` passed `error.message` straight to
 * `loadFailureView`, and a phone pointed at a host that was not running showed
 * `Reason: Unexpected token '<', "<!doctype "... is not valid JSON` on a wall.
 * That text says the theme file is corrupt; nothing was serving at all.
 *
 * Revert `showLoadFailure` to `error.message` and the first test below fails.
