 * `{...settings, [property]: value}` writes a shape the renderer never reads
 * while the validator shrugs: the author's choice survives the click and dies on
 * reopen. These two helpers are the write path, and their two exceptions are
 * exactly the two nested settings, named rather than generalised (ADR-0028).
