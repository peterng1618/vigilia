/**
 * The one place a Vigilia chart option becomes an engine option.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists rather than a cast at each call site
 *
 * The four `buildXOption` builders emit **Vigilia's** typed shapes — narrow,
 * reviewable, unit-tested objects that happen to be structured the way ECharts
 * wants. That is the point of "typed chart settings only": raw engine options
 * never enter the theme format, and a feature never reaches for
 * `EChartsCoreOption`.
 *
 * Handing one to `setOption` still needs a cast, because the builders describe
 * a deliberately small subset and ECharts' own type is enormous and largely
 * optional. **That cast is the engine boundary**, and the rule about it is that
 * there is exactly one. It used to live inline in `scene/mount.ts`; a second
 * renderer needed the same cast, and two of them is how a boundary becomes a
 * habit. Grep for `toEngineOption` to find every crossing.
 */

 * Each family's option type, keyed by `ChartFamily`.
