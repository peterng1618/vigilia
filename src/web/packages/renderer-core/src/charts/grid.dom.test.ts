/**
 * What the grid option does once it reaches the engine.
 *
 * ## Why this one test needs a DOM
 *
 * Everything else about the builders is decidable from the option object, and
 * `vitest.config.ts` runs in `node` for that reason. Two things here are not.
 *
 * **The deprecation.** `grid.containLabel` is deprecated in ECharts 6 and every
 * mount logged `[ECharts] Specified grid.containLabel but no
 * use(LegacyGridContainLabel); use grid.outerBounds instead`. Only a mounted
 * chart says that, so only a mounted chart can assert it stopped.
 *
 * **That the replacement is not inert.** The key it replaced *looked* applied
 * and was asserted by two unit tests; the instruction that follows from that is
 * to assert the layout rather than the key.
 *
 * Measured here 2026-09-15, one 400x240 line chart, plot-area left edge in
 * pixels — and note the first two rows, because spec 0013's review predicted
 * otherwise:
 *
 * | grid | plot left | plot bottom |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | `containLabel: true` (before) | 61.94 | 212 |
 * | `outerBoundsMode: 'same'`, `outerBoundsContain: 'axisLabel'` (now) | 61.94 | 212 |
 * | neither, i.e. ECharts' `'auto'` | 53.94 | 220 |
 * | `outerBoundsMode: 'none'` | 8 | 232 |
 *
 * So the deprecated key was **still honoured** — 6.1.0 routes `'auto'` to
 * `'same'` when it is set — and the change is exactly layout-preserving. What it
 * buys is the warning gone, no deprecated key in the emitted option, and no
 * dependence on a legacy module nobody registered. Nothing here looks at a
 * pixel; `jsdom` + `canvas` are only what let `echarts.init` measure text.
