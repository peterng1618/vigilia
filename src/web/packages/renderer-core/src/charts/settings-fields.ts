/**
 * Which settings each chart family accepts, as editable field descriptors.
 *
 * The **one owner** of that question (AGENTS.md's one-owner rule). It previously had four
 * encodings that nothing related: the settings interfaces in `types.ts` and
 * `charts/*.ts`, the `default*Settings` objects, `validate.ts`'s `KNOWN_KEYS`
 * plus its `validateSettingsRange`, and the JSON schema. The editor had a
 * fifth — none at all, which is why no chart setting was editable despite all
 * four families being fully typed and validated.
 *
 * ## What this declares, and what it deliberately does not
 *
 * Scalar settings only: numbers, booleans and enumerations. **Paint is not
 * here.** `track`, `progress`, `stroke`, `fill`, `area`, `remainderFill` and
 * the two `palette` arrays are all `Fill` — `solid | thresholds | gradient` —
 * and spec 0011 puts colour at the theme level. Persisted chart paint now
 * references palette tokens; its control still needs to author those references
 * and threshold-band offsets without writing literal colours onto a chart.
 *
 * ## Grouping and hints
 *
 * A long list is a navigability problem and navigation is the answer: a field is
 * grouped, never trimmed. Every descriptor answers one **question** — its
 * `section` — and the five questions are ordered in one place,
 * `SETTINGS_SECTIONS`. A chart's own settings answer Content, because they are
 * what the chart shows; paint answers Paint. A `hint` is **required**: it says
 * what the setting does in the author's language, so the label never has to
 * carry the whole meaning, and a descriptor without one does not compile.
 * `advanced` marks a field for the collapsed-and-counted treatment, never for
 * removal. **Which fields are `advanced` is a judgement, not a measurement** —
 * it is which settings an author reaches for rarely, and moving one costs
 * nothing but this list.
 *
 * ## Two settings one level down
 *
 * `path` names where a field writes when it is not the top-level `property`, and
 * `visibleWhen` asks it only in the state it applies to. Both exist for exactly
 * two settings — `PieSettings.total.value` and the optional `AnimationSettings`
 * block on all four families — which is why ADR-0028 chose a path over a nested
 * descriptor tree. A surface reads and writes them through `settings-path.ts`,
 * so the write path is the renderer's read path.
 *
 * ## It does not restate the defaults
 *
 * A field carries no default value. The `default*Settings` objects already own
 * those and the option builders already apply them, so repeating one here would
 * be a fifth home for a number that is only correct in one place. A field with
 * no authored value shows its placeholder and the renderer's default applies —
 * the same rule the style rows follow.
 *
 * ## Why the validator does not read this table
 *
 * `min`/`max` below are **authoring bounds**: the range a control offers and the
 * range its option builder clamps to. `validate.ts`'s `validateSettingsRange`
 * holds **invariants an adapter cannot recover from** — a gauge whose `max` is
 * not above its `min`, a fixed pie total with no finite value. Driving validation
 * from this table was the obvious next step and it is **decided against**
 * (ADR-0028): the two bound sets answer different questions, so consuming these
 * would start refusing documents that validate today. That is a data decision,
 * not a tidy-up, so the duplication stays — by decision, not by neglect.
 *
 * The other half of the old note is closed: `validateSettingsRange` is now an
 * exhaustive `switch (family)` with a `never` default, so a fifth family is a
 * compile error rather than falling through to the pie block.
