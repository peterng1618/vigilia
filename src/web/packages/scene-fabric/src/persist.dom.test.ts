 *
 * **The key sets are `toEqual`, never `toMatchObject`.** A subset match cannot
 * see a key that should *not* be there, and every key this format has had to
 * exclude — `subTargetCheck`, `interactive`, `layoutManager`, `renderScale`,
 * a built chart option carrying live samples — was a key nobody thought to look
 * for. The next Fabric minor adding one to `toObject` should fail here.
 *
 * **Identity is tested through a whole-canvas round trip**, not through one
 * object's `toObject`. `id` reaches the output as a `propertiesToInclude`
 * argument, so the interesting question is never "does `toObject` support it"
 * but "did the save path pass it" — and the failure when it did not is a
