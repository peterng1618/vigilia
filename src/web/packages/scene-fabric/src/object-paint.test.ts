 * `paintPropertyFor`, the rule that sends an icon's paint to the stroke.
 *
 * The pixels are proved in the editor's own selection-inspector suite; this is
 * the unit side — which property each object writes, and that the reference
 * survives a save and comes back as paint, since the panel now files it under
 * a different key than it used to.
