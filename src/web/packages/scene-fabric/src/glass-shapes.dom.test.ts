/**
 * The frosted treatment on the shapes that joined it: Circle, Ellipse, Triangle
 * and Polygon. What is proved here is **the clip path**, not the blur —
 * `node-canvas` accepts `ctx.filter` and ignores it — so every case asks whether
 * the frosted surface is confined to the shape's own geometry.
 *
 * The probe is the same each time: a point **inside the object's bounding box
 * and outside the shape**. A clip built from the bounding box reaches it; a clip
 * built from the shape's own geometry does not. That is what makes this a
 * rendering test rather than a check that a treatment exists, and it is why the
 * file is separate from `glass.dom.test.ts` rather than inside it.
 *
 * Every point is chosen with margin. A probe one pixel outside a shape lands on
 * the clip's antialiased edge and reads a faint wash instead of nothing, which
 * is a test that passes for the wrong reason.
