/**
 * What these tests can and cannot prove.
 *
 * `node-canvas` accepts `ctx.filter` and silently ignores it, so no test here
 * can show that a blur happened. They pin the composition around it — what is
 * sampled, what is excluded, what is clipped, what the radius converts to —
 * and the real blurred pixels are proved in the browser.
 *
 * The alpha Fabric has set **is** observable here, and a real `Group` is the
 * way to observe it. What is easy to get wrong is reading it from a *cached*
 * panel: Fabric renders a cached object into its own cache, whose context
 * carries no ancestor alpha, so the reading is 1 whatever the group's opacity
 * is. The glass handle switches that caching off, which is what makes the
 * grouped cases measurable — an earlier note here claimed the context itself
 * was unreachable, which was wrong.
