/**
 * The chart object's decisions and its shape.
 *
 * `vitest.config.ts` runs in a **node** environment and says why: unit tests
 * cover pure logic, and visual or cross-device behaviour belongs to Playwright.
 * So nothing here constructs a chart — that needs a document, a 2D context and
 * a live ECharts instance, and asserting against a fake canvas proves nothing
 * about the thing that draws.
 *
 * What *is* testable without a browser turned out to be more than "pure
 * functions". The class object, its statics and its prototype are all
 * inspectable in Node, and the one defect that reached `main` was a prototype
 * shape — so those are asserted here rather than deferred.
