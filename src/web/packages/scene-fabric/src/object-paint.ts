/**
 * Which Fabric property a paint the author picks belongs on.
 *
 * A `Path` carrying no fill is a stroked object, and this product already says
 * so: `newShapeStroke` fills nothing and is the palette's answer for a line, a
 * polyline and — by its own comment — a path. The Starter's icons are authored
 * the same way, `fill: null` and `stroke`/`strokeWidth` carrying the ink.
 *
 * Filling one of those paints whatever region its centrelines happen to
 * enclose, which for a stroke glyph is not the glyph. `starterIcons.storage`
 * declares one closed subpath and no second, so under any fill rule the whole
 * drive body floods and every counter closes: there is no hole in the data for
 * even one to open. What the author meant was the ink, so on an unfilled path
 * the ink is the stroke.
 *
 * Everything else is untouched. A path that arrives filled — a filled author's
 * glyph, the new-path default — keeps filling the region it encloses, and so
 * does a rounded card or a chevron.
 *
 * An unfilled arc is the same case for the same reason: it is stroked, and what
 * it spans is the region between the curve and its chord, which filling would
 * flood. Its wedge is not — a sector is a region, so it fills like any other
 * closed shape.
