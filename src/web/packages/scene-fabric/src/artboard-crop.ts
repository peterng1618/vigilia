 * outside is drawn nowhere — not shrunk, not scaled away, simply never painted —
 * and a reader cannot tell a short dashboard from a broken one. The editor
 * changes the artboard and kept saying the same sentence at every size, which is
 * the same measurement with the number left out.
 *
 * The counting lives here rather than in either surface because it is a fact
 * about the scene, not about what a display or an inspector chooses to say
 * about it.
