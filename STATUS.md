# Yunari status

Updated: 2026-10-23
Branch: `main`

## Current objective

Execute the **R2 store backend plan** ([`2026-10-23-r2-store-backend.md`](docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-23-r2-store-backend.md)): replace the GitHub catalogue with one Cloudflare Worker, D1 and private R2, with server-side counters, author unpublish and a Worker-computed version. The spec is [approved](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-22-r2-store-backend-design.md).

## Active work

- **Subagent-driven execution**: Phase 1, Phase 2 and Task 3.1 complete; Task 3.2 is dispatched (author unpublish/republish). Tasks 3.3–3.4 and Phase 4–5 follow in plan order.
- **Task 5.2 is the owner's**: creating the Cloudflare resources and deploying is prepared by the agent, run by the owner.
- **Queued, in order:** `2026-10-21-wallpaper-engine-import.md`, then `2026-10-21-asset-finder.md`; neither starts while this plan runs.
- **The catalogue is live with one real item**: `6041df49-9c61-4d51-a184-716890560bdb` (`Yunari smoke theme`, 1.0.0); Task 5.1 imports it.
- **Decision `0093`** records the backend's reuse gate and claims the four watched paths the plan writes.
- **Decisions `0088`–`0092`** carry the superseded GitHub store's measured choices; the plan keeps their wire shape and client rules.

## Last completed change

- **Author transitions land in `/api/me`**: `POST /api/me/items/:id/unpublish` and `/publish` reuse `setStatus`, 404 a foreign or missing id, and never touch counters, versions or objects.
- **`removed` stays the owner's**: republish answers 403 with the stored reason, and any state but `unpublished` is a 409 naming what it is.
- **`tests/unpublish.spec.ts` proves both**: every public read 404s while downloads, favourites, versions and R2 objects survive, and the listing returns on republish.

## Next

1. Execute the plan's phases in order; each task is reviewed before the next.
2. Weigh `vg-620` (a client disconnecting mid-stream kills the host) before the next plan opens.
3. After this plan closes, the user picks the next queued plan; the next register pass starts from `vg-691`…`vg-697`.

## Blockers / unverified

- **The rescoped remainder leaves player and host chrome outside the design language** (decision `0092`); they can drift from the editor's scales, and no instrument reports it.
- **The auto-merge workflow's unverified-author and ownership arms are reasoned from the YAML**, not exercised: both need a second GitHub account with a fork. PR #9 exercised only the verified-author first-submission arm.
- **No normalized video has been played back in a browser**, and the catalogue holds only the smoke item.
- **`server.test.ts` flakes on assignment cases** in about one full run in three, measured pre-existing at `5e5be86f` (`vg-695`).
