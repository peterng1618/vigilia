Branch: `claude/superpowers-workflow-cleanup`

## Current objective

Make authoring a theme a *good* experience, not merely a possible one. The
2026-09-24 author journey made every step reachable; the control surface is still
unpolished, and the canvas has no camera.

## Active work

- Three plans written, all awaiting review before execution:
  - `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-25-editor-ui-polish.md` (Spec B) — Figma-baseline
    layer tree, action registry behind dock and layer-panel row, dense inspector,
    Lucide icons, restrained reduced-motion-guarded transitions.
  - `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-25-editor-viewport-and-mechanics.md` (Spec A)
    — zoom/pan camera, group entry, reachable marquee, keyboard, context menu.
  - `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-25-snapping-fidelity.md` — port the fork's
    scale/resize snapping, relax the candidate filter, then replace the
    byte-length screenshot check with a move-and-resize behaviour matrix.
- Spec A is under execution, task by task; the other two have no execution
  method chosen yet.
- SDD ledger: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-24-author-journey.md` Task 6 is the
  only outstanding item in that plan.

## Last completed change

- Added `viewport-manager/`: `createViewportManager` owns the Fabric canvas's
  viewport transform, so pan and zoom pass one clamp in `pan-bounds.ts`
  (`PAN_OVERSCROLL_MARGIN` 48) and the camera never mirrors the transform.
- `resize`, `zoomToFit` and `zoomBy` refuse a zero-sized host instead of writing
  a collapsed canvas; `onChange` reports every camera change to its subscribers
  (Task 4's zoom readout) and `destroy` disconnects the observer and clears them.
- `viewport.test.ts` anchors on the identity transform before asserting the
  cursor point is fixed, so the jsdom zero-layout trap cannot make it vacuous.

## Next

1. Continue Spec A with Task 2 (the canvas becomes a viewport).
2. Close author-journey Task 6 once the e2e evidence lands.

## Blockers / unverified

- No verified full `npm run test:e2e` count yet: the earlier run never produced
  `test-results/summary.json`. Three spec acceptance items stay unverified —
  browser round-trip of text align/wrap/overflow, in-place edit + undo, and run
  preset/override persistence.
- Two pre-existing `display-fabric.spec.ts` phone-chromium failures hang at
  `document.fonts.ready` after `page.clock.runFor()`; not absorbed.
