# Vigilia status

Updated: 2026-10-18
Branch: `develop`

## Current objective

Give every display client its own theme: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-18-per-display-themes.md` (register `vg-574`) is active and lands before the theme store. The backlog drain resumes when its Phase 1 stops. Editor redesign contract: [spec](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-08-editor-design-language-design.md), [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md), and [checked drawings](docs/design/mockups/README.md).

## Active work

- **Active plan:** `2026-10-18-per-display-themes.md` — [plan](docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-18-per-display-themes.md), [spec](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-18-per-display-themes-design.md); execution ledger `.superpowers/sdd/2026-10-18-per-display-themes/progress.md`.
- **Phase 1 is active** (Tasks 1.1–1.8: the display record, its credential, pairing, the one-time code, the host's own monitors), made active by the user's 2026-10-18 ruling; Tasks 1.1 and 1.2 are closed and the pre-flight scan plus the review loops ruled R1–R11 into the ledger.
- **The backlog drain is suspended, not closed**: `2026-10-12-the-backlog-drain.md` resumes at Task 23.4, and its Phase 23 stays mid-phase with no seat running.
- Plan queue after this: `2026-10-18-theme-store.md` (its phase A only — B–G each need their own plan, G before C), then the panel work; the colour/gradient spec is unreviewed and unplanned.
- Recorded objectives rather than queued plans: a **native player app**, the only path to real device brightness (`vg-583`), and a **TURZX panel display** ([rough capture](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-18-turzx-panel-displays-design.md)), both sequenced after the theme store.
- Last census at `d4147298`: 129 open, 38 parked, 93 homeless, 56 homeless and unparked; `vg-538`'s parking makes that census historical — re-derive before quoting current totals.

## Last completed change

- Task 1.3 landed (task `bbb34289`, fix round `e3eff3fb`, note commit `eebdaaa5`): pairing mints, lists, renames and removes displays, rotation keeps the record and replaces the credential, and `DELETE /api/pairing/sessions/:token` is retired with its only caller.
- Its review found a `PATCH` rate the caller can fix answering 500 where the ruling makes it a 400 — corrected by exporting `normalizePatch` from the store rather than writing a second copy of the rule — and a decision note numbered `0068` colliding with one already on the mainline, renumbered to `0072` with the plan and STATUS following.
- Rung 4 of that note now names `decolua/9remote` at `033dd6e3`, the study the design already rests on, which the task brief never pointed at; the first instruction to add it arrived after the implementer's turn had ended, so the artifact was checked rather than the send assumed.
- Rulings R1–R14 are in the plan's ledger, including R13 (input the caller can fix is a 400) and R14 (the note number).
- Filed rather than absorbed: `vg-605` (two wire names that still say sessions while meaning displays) and, earlier, `vg-602`, `vg-603` and `vg-604`.

## Next

1. Task 1.4 (the one-time code and `/pair`) is next, and it owns four things the plan does not name: `vg-603`'s editor pairing client, the console link `main.ts` no longer prints (R8), the QR's payload (R11), and the code flow that replaces the mint (R9).
2. Review every task against its brief and evidence; run the phase gate with the exit code and the browser results named separately.
3. Resume the drain at Task 23.4 when per-display Phase 1 stops, then the theme store's phase A; resume Phase 21 after font-picker spec approval and Phase 12 after settings-pane spec review.
4. Re-home unparked rows carried only by closed phases; never treat a mention as a live implementation home.
5. Revisit redesign's final acceptance item after carrying rows land; propagate ruled acceptance text before closing `vg-390`.

## Blockers / unverified

- User review pending: [theme store](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-12-theme-store-design.md), [settings pane](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-16-settings-pane-design.md), [colour and gradient rebuild](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-12-colour-and-gradient-rebuild-design.md) and [font-picker keyboard model and budget](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-17-font-picker-keyboard-design.md); [display capabilities](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-18-display-capabilities-design.md) is **approved 2026-10-18 as panel-only** — no observable effect until a panel exists, so it is a phase of the panel work after this plan's Phase 1 creates the record it hangs on — and per-display itself is approved by the user's ruling to execute it.
- Decisions remain for `vg-546`, `vg-559`, `vg-350`, `vg-354` and `vg-191` (whose fixture Task 25.7 made unraisable, so it is the user's to withdraw or re-point rather than an agent's), and Phase 20 carried `vg-556` without closing it — do not invent approval or edit AGENTS.md.
- Phase 25 is complete but nothing in it ran on a physical phone, so every iOS and Android statement there is documentation; `vg-582`, `vg-588` and `vg-589` stay open, and `vg-587`'s handoff is that the secure origin is real but nothing advertises it — the printed pairing link, LAN banner, console pairing link, revoke curl, `hosting-client.ts`'s `displayUrl` and `publish-control.tsx`'s phone address all still print `http://`, and this plan's spec and plan still assert the host has no TLS, the user having ruled those surfaces belong to it.
- `vg-023`'s cancelled review needs an explicit user request to restart and `vg-370`'s resize refusal stays unestablished; `gate` runs unit tests rather than Playwright, so browser proof needs rebuilt bundles, one worker and each run's own JSON report.
- `vg-595` makes that proof unreliable rather than merely slow — the shared 4174 preview reuses an existing server, so a proof can be served by another worktree's `dist` and read green, as it did — and `vg-590` is the second file to redden that way, two being where "the box was busy" stops explaining one case; the editor e2e gate is red at the head on `publish-loop.spec.ts:402` (`vg-604`), a case that fails alone as well as with both specs and whose attribution is not established; no push is authorised, `develop` remains ahead of `origin/develop`, and local work plus untracked SDD records are preserved — and five Task 1.2 commits end with `Co-Authored-By: Claude Fable 5.0`, a string naming no real model from a garbled dispatch line of mine, left unamended because the ledger and every review package cite those shas, so it is the user's call.
