# Vigilia status

Updated: 2026-10-12
Branch: `develop`

## Current objective

**Rebuild the editor's GUI in the design language — the whole editor, every
frontend surface except the canvas.**

Plans 1–5, 7 and 8 are closed, and plan 6 is finished locally and archived; the
objective stays open on one blocked acceptance item. The target is
[`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md), the contract is
[`2026-10-08-editor-design-language-design.md`](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-08-editor-design-language-design.md),
the checked drawing is [`docs/design/mockups/`](docs/design/mockups/), and the boundary that
makes it affordable is
[0039](docs/decisions/0039-the-editor-ui-is-react-and-only-the-canvas-is-imperative.md).

**The drawing is the acceptance instrument, by the user's ruling of 2026-10-10:** the
mockup is not replaced and the shipped surface is pulled to it. The measure of done is the
spec's Acceptance section, counted rather than reviewed — and it is not met while a surface
satisfies every token in `DESIGN.md` and still does not look like the mockup.

## Active work

- **The active plan is [`2026-10-12-the-dead-code-sweep`](docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-12-the-dead-code-sweep.md)**, reordered by the user on 2026-10-12 to **managers, then dead code, then the register**: Phase 1 redistributes the manager layer (Tasks 8–9), Phase 2 the reference picture (1–3), Phase 3 removal (4–6), Phase 4 the register (7); **task numbers are stable identifiers, not positions**, because a dozen references cite them.
- **Phase 1's census is in its third fix round** — [`docs/architecture/manager-census.md`](docs/architecture/manager-census.md), landed at `a2fe5a89`, ranks ten candidates by shape and marks each clean extraction or cross-cutting; three rounds have corrected its stated evidence without moving a verdict, which is itself the finding about it.
- **Task 9 consumes those ranks in the census's order**: ranks 4, 5, 6 and 9 are clean extractions and go first, while 1, 2, 3 and 7 wait on decisions nobody has made — reach is the reason to be careful, not the reason to be first.
- **`snap-manager` is the largest code problem and is not an extraction candidate at all** — one external production module reaches it, so its fix is a protocol re-shape needing a spec, and the plan no longer calls it the split's worked example.
- **The sweep's rule is detection before deletion**, and the user set its bias on 2026-10-12 — *"I want a clean codebase but be careful to not overdo it and break the app"*: a survivor costs a ticket, a live symbol deleted costs the product.
- **Two plans are queued behind it**: [`the backlog reproduction pass`](docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-12-the-backlog-reproduction-pass.md), which re-derives its batches from the register at run time because a written count rots the moment a row is filed, and [`the keyboard-only walkthrough`](docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-12-the-keyboard-only-walkthrough.md).

## Last completed change

- **Task 1's fix loop closed at round 5 with no load-bearing finding** — five rounds, and the detection rules never moved: 311 candidates at 14 `dead-export` / 279 `redundant-export` are byte-identical across the last three, which is the property that matters when every round was about reporting.
- **The rule about a crash reading as a pass is now enforced on both artefacts** — the candidate marker is failure-shaped with `candidates` a truthy object rather than `[]`, which would only have moved the false pass to `candidates.length === 0`.
- **The re-review demonstrated the disarming rather than describing it** — the old intactness predicate, which tested for the presence of a key, returns **22/22 exit 0** on the new marker, and the tightened one returns 21/22 exit 1.
- **I escalated the atomic write instead of accepting it, and the answer came from establishing the readers** — no code reads either artefact except the script's own in-process checks, so a truncated write and an absent file are the same "no document" to a correct reader, and the write path adds no false-clean-sweep the marker does not already cover.
- **The census's round 2 closed R1 and R3 properly and was right about the count it corrected** — `asset-manager` is genuinely a §1.1 module-directory row, so sixteen was one short, and ranks 1–10 stay byte-identical to `a2fe5a89` because a plan and a register row cite them by number.

## Next

1. **The census's round 3 is running** — correcting the *evidence* it states for its rule, not the rule: one claim rests on a path-shaped search that could not see `ownership.md:75` naming `chart-manager`'s three files, and two others overstate what the rule tests.
2. **Task 9, the redistribution, when round 3 closes** — one manager per commit, the move relocates the *decision* rather than the code, it orders by the census's shape labels, and the map is updated in the same commit as the move.
3. **Phase 2's candidate report at HEAD, then per-candidate verification** — nothing is deleted until each candidate is checked against the string-resolved vocabulary: the `data-vigilia-*` attributes, the `--shell-*` custom properties, the `KIND_*` registries and the four gate scripts that read the source tree as data.
4. **`vg-368` waits on a decision** — whether `src/web/.agent-scratch/` is deleted, relocated outside the tree, or excluded per tool; deleting is not obviously safe because it holds screenshots and a vitest report that may be the only copy.
5. **The three failures the capture run surfaced** — `vg-359` (which also owns the one stale capture), `vg-360` and `vg-361`; nothing fixed on sight, because the first question for each is whether the surface moved or the locator did, and those want opposite fixes.

## Blockers / unverified

- **Acceptance item 3 now keeps the objective open on one thing: the census amendment.** Both of the user's 2026-10-12 rulings landed — §13.1 means a region with content, and `vg-358`'s unresolved reference is unreachable through the palette editor, so that item is discharged because the state cannot arise rather than because a surface was built for it.
- **Five specs are red on `develop` and each is named rather than left a mystery**: the two deliberate walkthrough reds, and `vg-359`, `vg-360` and `vg-361`, which fail deterministically on the built bundle; `vg-204` passed 5/5 at HEAD and so is not reproducing today but stays open pending a ruling, and `vg-363` is the opposite hazard — a non-deterministic fixture, since a bare editor mount resumes among themes whose mtimes tie, which is the class most likely to be misread as flake.
- **Read a run's own report and apply its `incomplete` marker** — `summary.json` reads green for the census that is committed red because it is another project's run; the scanner's reports carry `incomplete: true` from start-up because a crash used to leave the previous run's pass on disk; and the exit code alone is wrong too, since a red `desktop-host` project is expected here.
- **Every open row lives in [`docs/product/backlog.jsonl`](docs/product/backlog.jsonl), and every parked or unverified observation in the plans' ledgers with its ruling — but `.superpowers/` is now untracked, so a ruling recorded only there does not survive a fresh clone; durable decisions belong in [`docs/decisions/`](docs/decisions/), and promoting this session's is a deliberate act nobody has done.**
- **Unpushed:** `develop` is far ahead of `origin/develop` and no push is authorised.
