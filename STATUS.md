# Vigilia status

Updated: 2026-10-17
Branch: `develop`

## Current objective

Drain `docs/product/backlog.jsonl` through the active Superpowers plan. Editor redesign contract: [spec](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-08-editor-design-language-design.md), [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md), and [checked drawings](docs/design/mockups/README.md).

## Active work

- **Active plan:** `2026-10-12-the-backlog-drain.md` — [plan](docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-12-the-backlog-drain.md); execution ledger: `.superpowers/sdd/2026-10-12-the-backlog-drain/progress.md`.
- Phase 25 is active: the user's five 2026-10-17 reports (vg-568–vg-572), which they ordered ahead of Phase 22's remainder the same day; Task 25.1 is closed (vg-570) and 25.2–25.6 remain. Phase 22 is suspended with Tasks 22.1–22.5 closed (vg-147, vg-150, vg-192, vg-167, vg-168) and 22.6–22.10 pending, and it resumes after Phase 25. Phases 0–11 and 13–20 are closed; Phase 12, Phase 21 and Phase 22 are suspended, not closed; Phase 23 is queued.
- Phase 21 owes only Task 21.9 Step 3: font-picker keyboard implementation after user spec review and the separate `TAB_BOUND` ruling. Suspension changes scheduling, not either decision.
- **Plan queue, in order:** [`2026-10-18-per-display-themes.md`](docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-18-per-display-themes.md) (its [spec](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-18-per-display-themes-design.md) is unreviewed; four phases and seventeen tasks, and the store's assign action is its Task 4.4), then [`2026-10-18-theme-store.md`](docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-18-theme-store.md) (the store spec's phase A only — B–G each need their own plan, G before C). The colour/gradient spec is still unreviewed and has no plan.
- Register rulings and parked markers live on rows; ledger records completions/rulings, and `dispatch-*.md` records running seats. One phase and one implementation seat at a time.
- Last census at `d4147298`: 129 open, 38 parked, 93 homeless, 56 homeless and unparked; subsequent `vg-538` parking makes that census historical. Re-derive before quoting current totals.

## Last completed change

- The layer footer draws the registry's commands disabled with nothing selected, and the Add pane's construction buttons are gone from it — the answer `e572c302` built for `vg-460` was never requested (`vg-570`).
- The destructive mark now yields to a blocked control's tone: `[data-vigilia-destructive]` is scoped `:not([disabled]):not([aria-disabled="true"])`, because it was unlayered and outranked Tailwind's `text-faint`, so a disabled Delete painted `--hot` — identical to its enabled state.
- The browser case reads the idle footer's computed colour across the row rather than the `disabled` attribute, which is the gap that hid that paint; an independent review measuring colours found it after the first pass shipped.
- `vg-460`'s archived check now names the cases that pin it, and `hasSelection` is exported from `object-actions.ts` rather than re-spelled in the footer.

## Next

1. Execute Phase 25 serially, one seat at a time: 25.2 the banner's three-second clear, 25.3 the chrome controls (fullscreen, keep-awake, dimmer), 25.4 the chart's edge, 25.5 the phone re-fit, 25.6 the PWA.
2. Review each task against its brief and evidence; run phase gate with exit code and browser results named separately.
3. Resume Phase 21 after font-picker spec approval and budget ruling; resume Phase 12 after settings-pane spec review.
4. Re-home unparked rows carried only by closed phases; never treat a mention as a live implementation home.
5. Revisit redesign's final acceptance item after carrying rows land; propagate ruled acceptance text before closing `vg-390`.

## Blockers / unverified

- User review pending: [per-display themes](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-18-per-display-themes-design.md), [theme store](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-12-theme-store-design.md), [settings pane](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-16-settings-pane-design.md), [colour and gradient rebuild](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-12-colour-and-gradient-rebuild-design.md) and [font-picker keyboard model and budget](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-17-font-picker-keyboard-design.md); decisions remain for `vg-546`, `vg-559`, `vg-350` and `vg-354`, and Phase 20 carried `vg-556` without closing it — do not invent approval or edit AGENTS.md.
- Phase 25 owns the five 2026-10-17 user reports (`vg-568`–`vg-572`) and none is yet reproduced in a browser; `vg-576` is ruled (no settings modal — keep-awake, brightness and fullscreen are chrome) and `vg-577` makes the player an installable PWA, whose first write into the watched `host/src/serve/static-path.ts` needs a decision note first; brightness is a dimming overlay, never device backlight, and every client-support claim is unverified from this environment.
- Full browser suite's prior reds remain register-owned; `gate` runs unit tests, not Playwright. Browser proof needs rebuilt bundles, one worker, and each run's own JSON report.
- `vg-023`'s cancelled review requires explicit user request to restart; Fabric two-paint-context evidence remains controller browser proof. `vg-370` resize refusal remains unestablished.
- No push authorised. `develop` remains ahead of `origin/develop`; preserve local work and untracked SDD records.
